description:
  "The Tupolev Tu-28 (NATO reporting name Fiddler) is a long-range interceptor aircraft 
  introduced by the Soviet Union in the 1960s. The official designation was Tu-128, but 
  this designation was less commonly used in the West. It was the largest and heaviest 
  fighter ever in service. The Tu-128M variant is a 1979 modernization of almost all 
  existing aircraft for better interception at low altitude. Development originated in 
  1970. Engines and airframe were not altered. The full designation of the entire 
  weapons complex was Tu-128S-4M. It contained a new RP-SM Smerch-M radar, and new 
  missile set, a combination of R-4RM and R-4TM."
